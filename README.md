# 🚀 The Fullstack Journey

A personal collection of small but powerful web development projects as I explore the world of fullstack development — one step at a time. 🌱

## 🧪 Project 1: Flask Login System
A tiny login system built with Flask using sessions and routes.  
🔐 Users can log in with predefined credentials and get redirected to a dashboard.

📂 Folder: `Login-System`


---

## 💌 Project 2: Message Board
A simple and cute Flask-based message board web app.  
✍️ Users can leave their names and messages, which are then displayed with previous submissions.

📂 Folder: `Message-Board`
