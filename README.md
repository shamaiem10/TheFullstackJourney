# 🚀 The Fullstack Journey

A personal collection of small but powerful web development projects as I explore the world of fullstack development — one step at a time. 🌱

## 🧪 Project 1: Flask Login System
A tiny login system built with Flask using sessions and routes.  
🔐 Users can log in with predefined credentials and get redirected to a dashboard.

📂 Folder: `Login-System`

## 💌 Project 2: Message Board
A simple and cute Flask-based message board web app.  
✍️ Users can leave their names and messages, which are then displayed with previous submissions.

## 📝 Project 4: Flask Blog Site  
A minimal blogging platform made using Flask — no database, just good ol' Python and in-memory storage.  
🖋️ Users can write blog posts with a title and content, and see them displayed beautifully on the homepage.

📂 Folder: `Blog-Site`

## 🔮 Project 4: Forsee – Flask Fortune Teller  
A fun and mystical Flask web app that predicts your future!
